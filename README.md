# Statistics Playground

[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]

This is a collection of scripts and programs that I have on my computer to
do all sorts of statistics, maths, and just simply automate some of the
calculations I have to do.

The most important folder of all is `projects/`, there you'll find my main
statistics projects which are a lot better organized, have a goal in mind, and
are not quick hacks just to find an answer.

## Projects

Here are my main projects that you can find in this repository:

  - [battery-capacity](https://github.com/nathanpc/battery-capacity): Some
    measurements I did to accurately measure the true capacity of a bunch of
	batteries and brands (from AAA to 9V to lithium cells).
  - [package-wait](projects/package-wait): Analysis of the wait periods between
    a package being handed over to the carrier and it actually arriving. Used to
	determine the best carriers for each country.
